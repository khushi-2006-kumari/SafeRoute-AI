# Problem Statement - SafeRoute AI

## 🚨 The Safety Navigation Gap

Most navigation applications focus only on the shortest or fastest route and completely ignore user safety.

This becomes a serious problem during night travel, especially for women and students, where certain areas may have poor lighting, low crowd density, or higher crime risk.

## 📊 Supporting Statistics

- **73%** of women avoid certain routes due to safety concerns
- **45%** of students feel unsafe during night travel
- **60%** increase in safety incidents during night hours
- **0** major navigation apps prioritize safety over speed

## 🎯 Current Problem Areas

Users currently have no easy way to choose routes based on safety instead of only distance or time.

**Existing Solutions Fall Short**:
- Google Maps: Only considers traffic, not safety
- Waze: Focuses on speed and traffic avoidance
- Apple Maps: Optimizes for time and fuel efficiency
- No app considers: lighting, crowd density, crime statistics

## 💡 The Need

There is a strong need for a navigation system that considers safety factors such as:
- **Time of travel** (day vs night safety)
- **Crowd presence** (safety in numbers)
- **Risk-prone areas** (crime statistics and incident reports)
- **Infrastructure safety** (lighting, police presence)

## 🎯 Target Users

**Primary**: Women traveling alone, especially at night
**Secondary**: Students, elderly, tourists in unfamiliar areas
**Tertiary**: Anyone prioritizing safety over speed

## 🚀 Solution Vision

SafeRoute AI addresses this gap by providing **safety-first navigation** that helps users make informed decisions about their travel routes based on comprehensive safety data rather than just time and distance.
